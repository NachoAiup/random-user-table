# random-user-table

This is a React and TypesScript challenge found in YouTube. The main idea is to make it in the less amount of time possible, covering core React concepts and not getting into much CSS. The API  https://randomuser.me/ will be needed.

## Challenge steps: 

* Fetch 100 rows of data using the API.
* Display the data in a table format.
* Provide the option to color rows.
* Allow the data to be sorted by country.
* Enable the ability to delete a row.
* Implement a feature that allows the user to restore the initial state, meaning that all deleted rows will be recovered.
* Handle any potential errors that may occur.
* Implement a feature that allows the user to filter the data by country.
* Avoid sorting users again the data when the user is changing filter by country.
